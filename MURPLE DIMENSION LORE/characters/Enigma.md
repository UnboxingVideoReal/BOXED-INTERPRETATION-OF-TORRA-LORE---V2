# story
enigma ws born in a murple render. the rest of her species is normally cold blooded and violent like her friend mire. however, she is an outlier.

since her birth she did not show the normal signs of an average child. she was overtly kind, and unlike her parents, had empathy.

she would never kill. she never wanted to. she would wince at blood. 

her parents would often abuse her. it was just tradition for the entire species. most children her age would not see it as abuse. they would accept it and act like nothing was wrong.

but she wasn't normal (obviously). she would cry. something unknown to most of the people she knew. they saw her as weak for crying, so they would beat her more, assaulted her more, all to "make her stronger"

over time, she got used to it. she started seeing what others saw. she wouldn't speak a lot, unless you were new or very close to her. and she didn't consider her parents close.

her only escape was the outside. she loved to explore, catch whatever bugs there were, and pop murple bubbles. she found her best friend and future love through this. 




on a dark, dark night, enigma was admiring the murple caves of the local wasteforest. she heard a slip in the distance.

she was afraid but curious, so she hesitantly walked towards the sound. 

she found mire, hurt and bleeding, acting like nothing happened. 

enigma was very nice to her. mire had never felt this love - she was also abused by her parents.

they quickly bonded. even though mire was cold blooded and vicious, enigma still loved her and they would often spend every day together.




one night, she felt herself losing consciousness. but it wasn't like she was passing out.

she felt something control her. it felt like she was taken and put on the backseat, forced to watch everything without a say in what happened.

while she had control, she cried and cried harder than she had ever before.

then morning came. the control set in, but it didn't feel like it did that night. it was like her mindset completely changed. she only had one emotion - happiness. 

then, she suddenly wanted to go exterminate a render. no one knew what she was talking about. but she convinced mire to come with her.

with myserios's power, they crossed renders through a sort of invisible "wire" and were sent into the inverted render.

mire slowly got sick of her while they were exterminating. it took a few dimensions being destroyed for her to completely snap. 

she was confessing her love for enigma. the love she had felt since they first met. but she quickly got frustrated with how dumb enigma was acting. she lashed out at her, attacked her, and confronted her about the drastic change in enigmas brain.




over time, myserios's control over enigma started to wither. it wasn't built to withstand such emotional stress. she had barely any energy to continue destroying every dimension. for the short amount of time she had left, she cherished each moment with mire. she was finally able to live her true life with the one person she loved the most.

until she had to kill her. myserios still had a bit of control. it forced her to kill her by giving her the incentive to kill her and the entire render. 

she couldn't do it. but she did it anyway. she was sobbing and weeping as she gutted mire. 

and then soon enough she had nothing. 

no way to get home, no where to live.

among the weak and useless dimensions, she found the caves.

to this day, she continues digging for what she has lost.
