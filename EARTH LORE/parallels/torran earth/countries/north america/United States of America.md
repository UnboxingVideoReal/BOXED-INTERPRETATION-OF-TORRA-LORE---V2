The United States of America, referred to as the Union or the North after the American Civil War by other countries, but known legally and by the citizens as America or The United States, was formerly a growing superpower in the world, however the Civil War changed everything. In a fight against the newly declared Confederate States, the Union lost due to the invasion of Ottawa which turned Canada against the Union.
