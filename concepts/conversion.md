- conversion is the process of crossing the dimensional border. some borders can naturally create the necessary conversions for verted life to live in the inverted, but some cannot, and require artificial interference.
- for example, crossing over from the verted to the inverted and back requires no interference, as the great aslysmic bridge automatically converts verted energy to inverted energy.
- however, crossing over from the garden to the core requires an interference. this is THECOLON, which allows for easy transportation between the [[dimensions]] built by people of the core.
