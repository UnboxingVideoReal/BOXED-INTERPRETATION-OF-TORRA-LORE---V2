- witnesses are beings created either by myserios or soiresym that are made to take care of and monitor renders. they create [[access points]] to place in the render incase of an emergency that requires it.
- for new [[renders]], they create the necessary security for the render, if necessary.
- some witnesses, like planoy, experiment with their renders and create things like THEROT.
