the asteroid belt is a remnant of the creation of the solar system, so there are lots of [[Blackened Roots|blackened roots]]. almost every asteroid in the belt is connected by some amount of roots, creating a bridge.

the belt, like most root-infected objects, has [[life in the asteroid belt|blackened life]]. however unlike most, they get to see the stars, because the roots are exposed to space.

has [[Blackened Roots#Blackened Waves|blackened waves]]

has giant asteroid clusters held together by gravity, usually with a larger core asteroid in the middle and connected by a lot of roots in the center, with a giant heart in the middle of the cluster out in space.

around [[apollo]] and [[artemis]], there is a larger cluster held together by them. roots connect most of the asteroids. asteroids in the range are between a few kilometers away from eachother to 15k kilometers.
