size overall: 4.85436893% smaller than mars
same birth as [[the cavity|earth]]'s

however, as mars' habitable conditions dwindled 4 billion years ago, so did the cavity's, and all life in the cavity went extinct. the nests, idk what to call an extra layer in the nest caves and another one, all dried up. 

the roots in the heart panicked and started to pass through the core, into the now dead cavity and cover it in its roots in order to maintain balance and not collapse. it created the nest caves and then tried to penetrate the mantle and the surface to bring back life. 

however, while all this was happening, conditions in the deep heart were good enough to create planets and moons, and so [[THE NEW WORLD]] was formed, along with its 5 moons. technically, its not a planet from the verted, and is actually a planet from the blackened roots. because life grows differently in the blackened roots, it grew sapient life much faster than normal

now, it is still trying to pass thru the crust and into the surface to create life on the surface.
