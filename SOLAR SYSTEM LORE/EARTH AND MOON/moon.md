moon is very hollow. it also got infected (see [[the cavity]]) by the [[Blackened Roots#Interstellar Blackened Roots|Interstellar Blackened Roots]] and developed a giant cavity, so big it leaks to the surface and tjheres basically no surface. there are cracks on the moon that lead to the gigantic caves (and when i say giant i mean GIANT like so big you cant see the end of it)

also has [[cosmilite*]], LOTS of it
# caves
giant caves that u cant see the end of, big cosmilite* deposits and liquid cosmilite* deposits
# life
has bugs created by the blackened roots. some are as small as little mties, flies, and some as big as the biggest crabs and spiders, some even bigger
