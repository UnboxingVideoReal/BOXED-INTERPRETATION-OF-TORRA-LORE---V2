*flag of the csa, updated to include new states*

tensions have been growing in the us since an authoritarian regime was established, and since the wars with [[Canada|canada]] [[Republic of Texas|texas]] and the [[Confederate States of America|csa]] for territory, the regime has been attempting to assert more power over its citizens and the states. maybe like during [[World War III|ww3]] too? so like 2026-2028 somewhere around there

virginia, wvirginia, kentucky, maryland, and delaware cause of the whole authoritarian and stuff yea theyre sick of their word having no meaning and the government being nazi 2 so they make a plan with help from stronger countries like canada and the csa to secede and fight them with those countries. the seceded states join the csa

so its more like a war than a civil war but oh well

now that these states have seceded, every other state, also unhappy with the government, holds meetings with eachother to talk about either seceding with them or overthrowing their government. after long talks, they decide on overthrowing their government. some states are still more keen on seceding tho. they know canada and the csa would help

outcome: southern states leaving is reinforced (but the us still claims those states as part of the us) and now theyre a part of the csa. this inspires other states too (the war didnt last long) however instead of seceding (some states wanna secede, more southern states do), they have secret meetings with canada csa and other countries to revolt against the us government and establish a new government

this leads to the [[second american revolutionary war]] a year later, further exasperated by the us's antics in ww3
