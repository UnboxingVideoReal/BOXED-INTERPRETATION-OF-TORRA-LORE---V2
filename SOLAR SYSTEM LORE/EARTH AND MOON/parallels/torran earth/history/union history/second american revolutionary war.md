2027, only 10 states remain. (illinois, indiana, ohio, pennsylvania, new jersey, new york, connecticut, rhode island, massachusetts, vermont) no state is happy with the current government, especially with how its acting during ww3. for years - decades - theyve been ignored by the regime, lied to, and powers restricted. now, after the [[second american civil war|second civil war]], they are more confident than ever that they can overthrow their government.

blah blah blah stuff happens but basically its the government vs the ppl like ww3 and also [[Canada|canada]] the [[Confederate States of America|csa]] and [[Republic of Texas|texas]] help
