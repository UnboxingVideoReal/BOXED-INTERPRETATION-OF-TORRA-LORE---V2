ok what if
back to main earth
when they get good technology to scan the earth..
they cant scan that deep cause something is blocking it.. wtf..
gulp. MYSTERY
so they start digging
and then.. what.. its not that hot..
its hot but not that hot
its like
so you know how antarctica is cold
and for ppl in antarctica i want them to be used to it and be able to survive
but for the europeans who went to colonize they couldnt stand it
i kinda want this to be the opposite
its rlly hot but the ppl of the nests can stand it
but the ppl above they need to develop better equipment cause its too hot.. their equipment they thought was good enough turned out to be not
this new mystery virus could also introduce new minerals and ores..
and antarctica was just a sneak peak with the new gold
but.. gulp its way too deep so thjey dont get that close
so onto THE MOON
they find out wtf? its kinda hollow
its also infected
and theres GIANT caves
like so big it would look like the sky if the lighting were to be earths
and its filled with this [[selenium|new space fuel thing]]
but they dont know that yet they just know its shiny
and everywhere..
caves so big but theres not many entrances on the surface
so they have to dig down
