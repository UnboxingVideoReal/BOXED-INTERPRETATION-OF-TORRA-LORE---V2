Antarctica, even though it harbours a hostile environment with harsh temperatures and even harsher winds, can support all kinds of life including human life. While historically impossible for settlers to create permanent settlements further than the coast, native Antarcticans can live and thrive in the deserts, mountains, and caves of Antarctica.

# History
## The Wawaquanos
From the bottom of South America, the Wawaquanos (meaning “first in Antarctica” in Rivinyo), the first people to reach Antarctica, managed to sail below Tierra del Fuego and into the coast of the Trinity Peninsula, arriving on a vibrant landscape.

They settled in present day Arquq and for thousands of years, remained calm. They traded with their only partner and only connection to the outside world in Tierra del Fuego. Because of how scarce some resources were in Antarctica, they usually had to import from tribes in South America.

They eventually explored deeper into Antarctica, finding either lush environments or dead deserts. Some explorers found giant caves with lower temperatures that they could live in, so they settled in them. The caves were huge, and often interconnected. However, surface explorers soon reached the Transantarctic Mountains. They were met with a dead end, for now. 

On the mountains and in the caves were geothermal vents, perfect for civilization. They also settled in these mountains near the vents. To drink water, they melted ice and then boiled the water to purify it. Soon, they crossed the mountains and conquered the rest of Antarctica, living all throughout West and East Antarctica (but mainly West) and underneath in the caves.
## Advancements
The Wawaqs, inhabitants of Antarctica, quickly advanced and developed huge cities that almost paralleled European cities at the time. Compared to other natives and Europeans, they were more like Europeans than any other group. They had steel and a thriving economy. 

They developed their own paper from the [temp name] plant, similar to the papyrus plant in Egypt. They developed governments like European countries in the 1800s, way before the 1800s even arrived. They had a strong alliance between every country in Antarctica before they united, and traded with eachother. They were so close, they were often referred to as one country, named “Cry” (pronounced cree)

Artistically, they were incredibly talented. They drew in ice, caves, made sculptures and statues, made paintings with their limited colors, and made beautiful buildings. 
## European Contact
On the 27th of January, 1820, Russian explorers were stopped by impassable ice on the coast of East Antarctica, which made it impossible to land. However, in the distance, they were spotted by a group of Wawaqs. The explorers saw them, and were surprised. They didn’t know whether to report back, or to continue with their expedition.

In fear of being attacked, they decided to return back to Russia. In 1821, they report back to Russia about the people in Antarctica. The Wawaqs they encountered ran to the city’s representative for the alliance, and told him all about an unknown group of people who looked nothing like the South Americans they knew or anyone from Antarctica. 

However, a British explorer arrived on the coast of the Trinity Peninsula 3 days after Russia on the 30th, which means they encountered the giant city of Arquq, the capital. Residents found them and a group quickly gathered to watch. The explorers were able to find their way to the port with the help of the residents. The British were surprised with how advanced they were, and how similar their cities were to their own. They were surprised that they could survive in this environment.

They landed on the city, and they found that the residents seemed to be expecting them. Because the leader of the Wawatu Kuttu (Antarctic Alliance) lived in Arquq, she quickly left to meet the explorers. She parted the group and faced them, holding drawings, diagrams, artifacts, and papers of parts of their culture, what they had to offer, and a way to communicate with them. She also brought with her pens and empty sheets of paper.

They started to trade information and resources, and the British came back with a lot of information. While they returned later than the Russians, they came back with much more than them. The Russians brought with them the panic that they were not alone in Antarctica, while the British had gifts, paintings, writing, and maps.

A huge issue colonial powers had to get over was the harsh cold and extreme winds. They could not take over the continent like they were doing in the Americas and Oceania, so they had to work with the people of Antarctica.

Now that the Wawaqs know about the Europeans, they are eager to get closer to them and be globally important. They fell in love with their culture, language, and technology, and many wanted to be part of the larger world. To further represent all of Antarctica to the rest of the world, they united as one power called Cry.

## Antarctic Mythril Rush
For years since, trading between Wawaqs and the rest of the world was done with caution. They did not want to destroy populations like they did in the 1400s, so to limit the spread of foreign diseases, they would quarantine themselves after trading and wore lots of clothing and barely made physical contact. 

Along with trading, many Wawaqs were also leaving Antarctica, either being forcefully taken as slaves, or willingly getting on ships. Many left to Europe yeayeayeyeayea

France made a colony near the Transantarctic Mountains but near the coast. It was struggling, and there were many deaths. It was met with heavy pushback from the people nearby, but soon, in 1842, the French made a huge discovery - there was a lot of [[mythril]] near the Transantarctic Mountains, a new mineral to the Europeans. The Wawaqs were trying to hide this from everyone else to avoid it being taken away from them. 

France however didn’t bring lots of mythril, however brought with them the knowledge of mythril in Antarctica. Britain, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Rome, Russia, and the U.S. all tried to establish colonies in Antarctica, but were all met with very strong force by the people, and the strong force of the winds and the cold. Almost all the colonies failed or lasted very shortly, and very little profit was made.

After decades of failed colonization, most colonial powers already gave up. The ones that remained were France, Rome, and Britain. But those soon gave up too. In 1877, the Antarctic Withdrawal Treaty was signed between all colonial powers and Cry, which ordered for the withdrawal of all foreign powers in the continent and declared Antarctica its own country.
