the cavity formed inside the earth during its creation because it was infected with interstellar [[Blackened Roots]], a form of the blackened roots which infected multiple dimensions and modifies the geography, life, and entire science on the planet. an example of this is humans being able to survive extreme temperatures on antarctica, and its lush environment with biomes that dont make sense.

the planet then develops a cavity, and the core is held together by the roots until it fully develops what it needs to survive and to reduce the stress put on itself. in earths case, it developed the nests, the hives, the cysts, and then settled deep inside the core as a pocket of blackened roots.

to pass on its genes and the virus, it can create life in the cavity if the planet outside it is sustainable, or if conditions inside are sustainable enough (conditions are not the same as it is for outside planets)

everything living being is powered and gets its energy from the blackened roots in the core, a small heart in the core which has a lot of blackened roots. 

consists of:
- [[mantle]]
- [[the nests]]
- [[the hives]]
- [[the cysts]]
- [[the core (earth)]]
- [[the heart]]

# the hives
size overall: 45.68345324% smaller than entire earth


# the cysts
