very wip
# 3rd millenium in space
1945-1990 - [[Cold War|cold war]], few discoveries in astronomy 


1990-2026 - more discoveries but not cold war level


2026-? - [[World War III|ww3]], little discoveries

?-2060 - pre-space race, some discoveries and stuff between a few countries

2060-2200 - space race. [[moon]] and technology up to like irl rn by the 2120s. they also discover theres weird readings below the surface and then more readings of the moon reveal the same weird readings and they find large caves. they also discover the [[lower ocean]] and try to explore it

at first its peaceful the discovery cause they dont know about [[selenium]], but once its found and used in rockets and other things as fuel and stuff they get rich and other countries start to panic and wanna start to take over the moon so they start improving too and sending rockets tjhere and focusing on making mining bases.

however, there is no outer space treaty. countries start claiming parts of space and parts of the moon for their bases.

a country starts sending probes to venus and mars cause maybe they have stuff and especially selenium and they come with new data: theres people there but the readings are weird so theyre not 100% sure. 

the probes dont land on a populated area but they land on a place to get pictures, so no venus ppl are alerted. however years later a manned expedition to venus is made with the intention of determining whether people exist or not and when they get past the atmosphere, they can see some cities so they land on the closest one 

however the venus ppl had their own theories of aliens, they knew of the earths existence and that it was green, and they developed plans for what to do when aliens come. so, they are prepared but still scared of the humans. the humans are stressed because of the intense heat, however they are impressed at how the venus ppl can survive and advance in these conditions. they trade and eventually come back with good loot

also by the end they discover [[minerva]] i think

EVERYTHING BEYOND THIS POINT IS OLD AND IM STILL WORKING ON IT:

2200-? - wars in space over territory and the moon. more landings on the moon and bases established on the moon, mining and stuff

# discovery of the nests and other ppl
?-2400 - with the new fuel, they can now get to other planets faster so they do that and go to every rocky planet. in venus they discover people on the surface, and in the asteroid belt. they also cotinue trying to dig down, and eventually discover the 2nd ocean.

maybe in this time we can have another war cause wremember i talked abt wanting to have reason for countries being so colonization-minded in the future

2400-2700 - colonization of venus and the asteroid belt + apollo/artemis, similar to colonization of america and australia, but more like antarctica because the space ppl are actually stronger cause like i said theyre not ppl missing an entire half of the world or the rest of the world, they have the entire world to themselves

exploration of gas giants too they make bases and stuff. by this time theres already cities on different planets, mainly mars and the moon but theyre trying to make some on venus and the asteroid belt

idk what i want the outcome of colonization to be.. do i make them win or lose..


2700-2900 - depends on the outcome of colonization.. i want them to kinda like win and lose at the same time..
