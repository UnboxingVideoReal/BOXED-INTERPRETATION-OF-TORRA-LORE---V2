# 3rd millenium in space
1945-1990 - cold war, few discoveries in astronomy 


1990-2026 - more discoveries but no [[Cold War|cold war]]


2026-? - [[World War III|ww3]], little discoveries


2100-2200 maybe a few decades before - [[moon]] and technology up to like irl rn. they also discover theres weird readings below the surface and then more readings of the moon reveal the same weird readings and they find large caves 

at first its peaceful the discovery cause they dont know the power of [[cosmilite*|the purple ore]], but once its used in rockets and other things as fuel and stuff other countries start to panic and wanna start to take over the moon so they start improving too

also by the end they discover [[minerva]]


2200-? - wars in space over territory and the moon. more landings on the moon and bases established on the moon, mining and stuff

# discovery of the nests and other ppl
?-2400 - with the new fuel, they can now get to other planets faster so they do that and go to every rocky planet. in venus they discover people on the surface, and in the asteroid belt. they also cotinue trying to dig down, and eventually discover the 2nd ocean.

maybe in this time we can have another war cause wremember i talked abt wanting to have reason for countries being so colonization-minded in the future

2400-2700 - colonization of venus and the asteroid belt + apollo/artemis, similar to colonization of america and australia, but more like antarctica because the space ppl are actually stronger cause like i said theyre not ppl missing an entire half of the world or the rest of the world, they have the entire world to themselves

exploration of gas giants too they make bases and stuff. by this time theres already cities on different planets, mainly mars and the moon but theyre trying to make some on venus and the asteroid belt

idk what i want the outcome of colonization to be.. do i make them win or lose..


2700-2900 - depends on the outcome of colonization.. i want them to kinda like win and lose at the same time..
