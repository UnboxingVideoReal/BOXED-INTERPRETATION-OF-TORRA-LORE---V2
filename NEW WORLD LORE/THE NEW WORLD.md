*the new world in the heart in the very middle*

because it is in the heart, it is surrounded by roots, so the sky is roots. because of this, there are [[blackened waves]] in the heart and nests that you can ride on. between the core and the new world.

has a ring made out of a mixture of the roots and the core. because the roots are connected to the core, it courses through the roots like blood through veins and it creates light in the heart. the light goes down the roots, reaching down to the planets and moons. this creates a day-night cycle inside the heart because the light has to take time going down the roots to reach the destination.
