THE ROT is the source of all wrong in the world of the renders of [[#THE INFIRMARY]] and [[#THE NURSERY]], and the antonym to all life.

it was created by a witness named [[PLANOY]] in THE INFIRMARY and spread to almost every render, and crossed over to THE NURSERY.

torra lore rot:
> ok so the rot is like people were trying to invent new people by having a vessel and putting their emotions into it or smth?
> but most emotion is bad emotion (it was invented in the walls cities and thats a shitty place to live)
> the vessel  being THE BOTTLE BEING
> the silverline in humanoid form
> but it failed cause you cant give human emotions to something that isnt human
> like how a mushrooms emotoin is different from human emotion 🗣️ 🔥
> and cause the vessel wasnt suppose to have emotions it manifested into THE ROT
> cause it needed to become something
