*not to be confused with the [[Blackened Roots (dimension)|Blackened Roots]], the dimension in THE INTERCEPT*

the blackened roots is [[THE ROT|a rot]], originating in the [[Blackened Roots (dimension)|blackened roots]] dimension in the intercept. because it is one of the first rots to come from the rot itself, it is bad and has had more time to develop and spread.

when it reached the intercept, it started to coalesce and create [[ACOREA]] slowly, first composed of matter but then, fruit from the roots started to detach and then merged with the roots again to expand. 

next, to continue its spread, it decided to create a virus to infect other bodies and other dimensions. it created the [[#Interstellar Blackened Roots]] virus, which can create life from the blackened roots in whatever dimension.

# Interstellar Blackened Roots
## in [[THE INVERTED DUO]]
### rocky planets/asteroids
for planets during formation, it will sink to the center and create a heart which is a lot of blackened roots. it lets the core form around itself. then, like a virus, it modifies instructions on how to form like mantle and all that and instea dit creates a cavity. it may create nests and more.

ideally it wants to create life to further create more acoreas to then merge with acorea. conditions required are different from conditions required for life on regular planets. if life on a planet is already supported, it will depend on it. if it goes extinct, it will start to dry up and panic, and the heart will reach out out of the core, cover the cavity and create nest caves out of the corpse of the cavity. then, it will pass the mantle and crust and cover the surface with its roots, attempting its life onto the surface.

orbiting objects will also attempt to be connected by roots
